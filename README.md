This is a theoretical mathematical model that allows using similar structures to brain neural connections to discard any non-deviant behavior during training, which (as can be seen from the initial graphs) allows in theory to build self-learning AI models that will later replace current AI training methods. If you want to hear a more detailed explanation with possible examples, contact me on my telegram @biblefer or by email ivan.kuz2323@gmail.com
But as can already be seen from the graphs, at some point the training of such a model tends to almost 100% efficiency, a similar model can be used not only for training AI, but also in psychology, sociology, healthcare and business.
I am currently working on implementing this algorithm in C, as well as other projects that can help us in further development.



# Brief overview of the project

Project Objective:
The project aims to develop and integrate a new mathematical model for adaptive systems and AI based on the analysis of cognitive patterns and phase shifts. The main objective is to create a product that will optimize the behavior of systems, improve their ability to self-learn and adapt to changes in real time.

Technical aspects:

Mathematical model:

The product is based on a model of cognitive patterns that tracks and analyzes the behavior of the system, as well as phase shifts that occur when the state changes.

The model allows you to predict changes in the behavior of the system, which helps optimize its response to changes in the external environment.

Application in AI and adaptive systems:

The product integrates with neural networks, self-learning algorithms and autonomous systems to improve their adaptive capabilities.

Using phase shifts improves system adaptation by minimizing ineffective deviations and optimizing the learning process.

Practical application:

The product can be used in various areas: from autonomous systems (e.g. robots, cars) to financial solutions, where it is important to quickly respond to changes in the market and optimize operational processes.

In the field of data security, the product will help adapt security systems by predicting threats and effectively responding to changes in the security level.

Development strategy:

MVP (Minimum Viable Product):

Development of a basic version of the model, which includes: analysis of cognitive patterns, phase shifts and basic visualization.

Creation of a simple interface for working with the product and testing on real data.

Integration with existing projects:

Using a repository on GitHub, which includes self-learning AI models, to add phase shift algorithms and improve the adaptive capabilities of systems.

Testing and Feedback Collection:

Conducting tests on real data, analyzing the system's behavior and its reactions to changes in the external environment.

Collecting feedback from potential users, including research organizations, startups, and companies working in the field of IT and AI.

Potential markets and audience:

AI developers and IT and technology startups working with neural networks and adaptive systems.

Research organizations in the field of cognitive science, psychology, and neurobiology.

Autonomous systems, such as robots and unmanned vehicles.

Corporations that want to optimize their operational processes and business strategies using AI.

Conclusion:
The project is an innovative development in the field of adaptive systems and AI. The use of cognitive patterns and phase shifts allows you to create a highly efficient system that can adapt in real time. The product has great potential for application in various fields, including autonomous technologies, AI training, business process optimization, and data security.

Successful implementation requires investment in MVP development and testing on real data. In case of successful integration and receiving positive feedback from users, the project can expand its presence in the market and become a sought-after tool for adaptive systems.
